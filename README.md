# Job Recommendation System

## Overview

The Job Recommendation System is a web application designed to help job seekers find relevant job listings based on their resume content. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to recommend jobs that best match the skills and experience outlined in the user's resume. The system also includes features for job search, user authentication (signup and login) (still working), and a responsive design for a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Resume Upload**: Supports uploading resumes in TXT, PDF, DOC, and DOCX formats. Extracts and processes text from the resumes.
